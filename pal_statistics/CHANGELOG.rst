2.2.3 (2023-12-18)
------------------
* Merge branch 'fix/flaky_macro_asyncPublisher' into 'humble-devel'
  Fix/flaky macro async publisher
  See merge request qa/pal_statistics!36
* Improve test failure messages
* Make gtest failure messages more informative in aync tests
  For instance from:
  /home/user/exchange/roses/alum/pal_statistics_ws/src/pal_statistics/pal_statistics/test/gtest_pal_statistics.cpp:580: Failure
  Value of: waitFor( std::bind( stats_published_for, "macro_var1", "clp-failure", "macro_var1_bk", "macro_var2", "&var2\_"))
  Actual: false
  Expected: true
  to:
  /home/user/exchange/roses/alum/pal_statistics_ws/src/pal_statistics/pal_statistics/test/gtest_pal_statistics.cpp:673: Failure
  After 300 msValue of: get_variables
  Expected: has 9 elements and there exists some permutation of elements such that:
  - element #0 is equal to "macro_var1", and
  - element #1 is equal to "clp-failure", and
  - element #2 is equal to "macro_var1_bk", and
  - element #3 is equal to "macro_var2", and
  - element #4 is equal to "&var2\_", and
  - element #5 is equal to "topic_stats.pal_statistics_node_test/pal_statistics.publish_async_attempts", and
  - element #6 is equal to "topic_stats.pal_statistics_node_test/pal_statistics.publish_async_failures", and
  - element #7 is equal to "topic_stats.pal_statistics_node_test/pal_statistics.publish_buffer_full_errors", and
  - element #8 is equal to "topic_stats.pal_statistics_node_test/pal_statistics.last_async_pub_duration"
  Actual: { "topic_stats.pal_statistics_node_test/pal_statistics.publish_async_attempts", "topic_stats.pal_statistics_node_test/pal_statistics.publish_async_failures", "topic_stats.pal_statistics_node_test/al_statistics.publish_buffer_full_errors", "topic_stats.pal_statistics_node_test/pal_statistics.last_async_pub_duration", "macro_var1", "macro_var1_bk", "macro_var2", "&var2\_" }, which has 8 elements
* Create helpers for better failure messages in async tests

2.2.1 (2023-11-14)
------------------
* Merge branch 'fix/flaky_chaos_test' into 'humble-devel'

2.2.0 (2023-10-19)
------------------
* Merge branch 'fix/crash_when_start_publish_called_twice_for_same_topic' into 'humble-devel'
  Fix: prevent crash when publisher thread is recreated
  See merge request qa/pal_statistics!33
* Use make_shared as per CR
* Test statistics publish thread can be called multiple times
* Fix: interrupt_thread flag could stay true forever
  This hinders the execution of the publisher thread, making
  it exit prematurely.
  For instance, in case joinPublisherThread() is called when no
  publisher_thread\_ is still ready:
  1. startPublishThread()
  1.1. joinPublisherThread()
  1.1.1. interrupt_thread\_ set to true
  1.1.2. publisher_thread\_ is null, no further actions
  1.2. new thread created for publisherThreadCycle()
  2. In publisherThreadCycle, interrupt_thread\_ is true
  2.1. thread finishes
* Fix use proper event to interrupt the publisher thread
* Fix: prevent crash when publisher thread is recreated
  publisher thread was destroyed before being joined causing
  the termination of the process
